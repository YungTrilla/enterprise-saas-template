# Enterprise SaaS Template - Modularity Checklist

## ðŸš¨ VERIFY BEFORE EVERY COMMIT

### 1. Explicit Architectural Blueprints & Design
- [ ] Detailed Modularity Prompts: Are prompts explicitly requesting modular design with constraints for individual modules?
- [ ] Interface Definition (API-First): Have clear APIs/interface contracts (OpenAPI specs, function signatures) been defined for each module *before* generating full code?
- [ ] Design Pattern Specification: Are specific software design patterns being used to promote modularity (publish-subscribe, dependency injection)?
- [ ] Security Architecture Planning: Has security been designed into each module from the start (not bolted on)?

### 2. Architectural Style Guidance
- [ ] Microservices/SOA Implementation: Are distinct services developed as separate, independent components?
- [ ] 4-Layer Architecture Within Apps: Are applications structured with distinct layers?
  - [ ] Presentation Layer (UI): Handles user interaction only
  - [ ] Business Logic Layer: Contains application-specific rules and workflows  
  - [ ] Data Access Layer: Manages database/data store communication
  - [ ] API Layer: Exposes functionality to other internal services
- [ ] Independent Components: Are features broken into smaller components with well-defined responsibilities?
- [ ] Event-Driven Patterns: Are event-driven approaches used for loose coupling between services?

### 3. Standardization of Communication and Data
- [ ] Inter-Service API-First Design: Do services communicate only through well-documented APIs (no direct access)?
- [ ] Internal Component Interfaces: Are clear contracts defined between layers/components within apps?
- [ ] Shared Libraries for Common Concerns: Are core shared libraries being developed/utilized for auth, UI themes, cross-cutting concerns?
- [ ] Component-Based UI Architecture: Are reusable UI components developed for consistent theming?
- [ ] Common Data Models: Are standardized data formats (JSON schemas) defined and enforced for inter-service information exchange?
- [ ] Centralized Authentication: Is unified authentication implemented as shared service?

### 4. Human Oversight and Iterative Refinement
- [ ] Human Architectural Oversight: Has a human architect defined overall modular structure and interfaces?
- [ ] Module-Specific AI Prompts: Are AI agent prompts narrowly focused on specific modules/boundaries?
- [ ] AI Agent Isolation: Are AI agents prevented from accessing internals of modules they're not assigned to?
- [ ] Modularity-Focused Code Reviews: Is code being reviewed specifically for adherence to modular design, interface contracts, and separation of concerns?
- [ ] AI-Assisted Refactoring: Are specific prompts being used to refactor monolithic code into modular structures?
- [ ] Iterative Modular Development: Starting coarse, then iteratively refining modularity?
- [ ] Task Decomposition: Are complex development tasks broken down into smaller, focused assignments?

### 5. Tooling and Development Environment
- [ ] Modular Version Control: Are different modules managed with reinforced separation (separate directories, clear boundaries)?
- [ ] Rigorous Testing Strategy: Are comprehensive tests implemented?
  - [ ] Unit Tests: Individual modules/components tested in isolation
  - [ ] Integration Tests: Component interactions within apps tested
  - [ ] Contract Tests: Inter-service API communication verified
  - [ ] Security Tests: Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, security audits
- [ ] Automated Interface Testing: Are automated tests implemented for each module, focusing on defined interfaces for independent functionality?
- [ ] Minimize Direct Dependencies: Do components interact only through declared interfaces?
- [ ] Security Tooling Integration: Dependency scanning, container scanning, SAST/DAST tools configured?

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Review this checklist before every development session and commit!
