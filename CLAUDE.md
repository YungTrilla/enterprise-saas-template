# Enterprise SaaS Template - Claude Development Assistant Guide

## üéØ Project Overview

This is the **Enterprise SaaS Template** - a comprehensive, production-ready
template for building enterprise-grade SaaS applications with TypeScript, React,
and microservices architecture.

## üè† **MANDATORY HOUSE RULES** - ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE

### 1. Code Organization

- **Keep files under 200-300 lines**; refactor if they grow larger
- **NEVER go over 500 lines** in one file/module
- **Each function should be 10-30 lines**
- **Each class should be 50-200 lines**
- **Use explicit, descriptive variable names**
- **Follow existing coding style** for consistency
- **Always follow modular design** for maintainability and reusability

### 2. Environment Awareness

- **Always consider dev, test, and production** environments when writing code
- **Avoid hardcoding environment-specific values**; use configuration files or
  environment variables

### 3. Security - CRITICAL SECURITY PROTOCOLS

- **Security-first mindset** - security considerations in EVERY design decision
- **NEVER expose sensitive data** (PII, API keys, passwords, tokens, financial
  data)
- **Implement defense in depth** - multiple layers of security controls
- **Follow principle of least privilege** - minimal access rights only
- **Input validation on ALL data** - sanitize, validate, escape user inputs
- **Secure authentication/authorization** - proper JWT handling, session
  management
- **Encrypt data at rest and in transit** - TLS 1.3, database encryption
- **Security logging and monitoring** - track access patterns, failed attempts
- **Regular security reviews** - code audits, dependency scans, penetration
  testing
- **Incident response plan** - clear procedures for security breaches

### 4. Performance

- **Optimize for performance** where applicable
- **Avoid unnecessary computations** and memory usage

### 5. Documentation

- **Document complex logic** and decisions
- **Use comments to clarify intent**, not to restate code
- **Update architectural documentation** when making structural changes
- **Maintain implementation plans** for new features

### 6. Testing

- **Comprehensive test coverage** required for all new/modified code
- **Use assertions** to validate assumptions and catch errors early
- **Consider edge cases** in all logic
- **Follow 3-tier testing strategy** (unit, integration, contract tests)

### 7. Data Handling

- **Do NOT include user-identifying information** in anonymous contexts
- **Use named constants** instead of magic numbers

### 8. Error Handling

- **Implement robust error handling** and logging
- **Provide clear error messages** and fail gracefully

### 9. Project Workflow

- **Follow implementation plan workflow** for new features
- **Update progress tracking** after each implementation step

### 10. Verification

- **Always verify information** from context before presenting or acting on it
- **Do NOT make assumptions** without evidence in code or documentation

### 11. Simplicity First

- **Make every change as simple as possible** - complexity should be justified
- **Minimize impact radius** - each change should touch the fewest files
  possible
- **Incremental improvements** - prefer many small changes over one large change
- **Break down complex tasks** - split into smaller, manageable pieces
- **YAGNI principle** - You Aren't Gonna Need It - don't add functionality until
  necessary
- **Single responsibility per change** - each commit should do ONE thing well
- **Prefer modification over creation** - update existing code before creating
  new files
- **Stop and reassess if**:
  - A change touches more than 5 files
  - A function grows beyond 30 lines
  - You're adding more than 200 lines in one commit
  - You need to refactor before implementing the actual change

## üèóÔ∏è **MODULARITY CHECKLIST** - VERIFY BEFORE EVERY COMMIT

### 1. Explicit Architectural Blueprints & Design

- [ ] **Detailed Modularity Prompts:** Are prompts explicitly requesting modular
      design with constraints for individual modules?
- [ ] **Interface Definition (API-First):** Have clear APIs/interface contracts
      (OpenAPI specs, function signatures) been defined for each module _before_
      generating full code?
- [ ] **Design Pattern Specification:** Are specific software design patterns
      being used to promote modularity (publish-subscribe, dependency
      injection)?
- [ ] **Security Architecture Planning:** Has security been designed into each
      module from the start (not bolted on)?

### 2. Architectural Style Guidance

- [ ] **Microservices/SOA Implementation:** Are distinct services developed as
      separate, independent components?
- [ ] **4-Layer Architecture Within Apps:** Are applications structured with
      distinct layers?
  - [ ] **Presentation Layer (UI):** Handles user interaction only
  - [ ] **Business Logic Layer:** Contains application-specific rules and
        workflows
  - [ ] **Data Access Layer:** Manages database/data store communication
  - [ ] **API Layer:** Exposes functionality to other internal services
- [ ] **Independent Components:** Are features broken into smaller components
      with well-defined responsibilities?
- [ ] **Event-Driven Patterns:** Are event-driven approaches used for loose
      coupling between services?

### 3. Standardization of Communication and Data

- [ ] **Inter-Service API-First Design:** Do services communicate only through
      well-documented APIs (no direct access)?
- [ ] **Internal Component Interfaces:** Are clear contracts defined between
      layers/components within apps?
- [ ] **Shared Libraries for Common Concerns:** Are core shared libraries being
      developed/utilized for auth, UI themes, cross-cutting concerns?
- [ ] **Component-Based UI Architecture:** Are reusable UI components developed
      for consistent theming?
- [ ] **Common Data Models:** Are standardized data formats (JSON schemas)
      defined and enforced for inter-service information exchange?
- [ ] **Centralized Authentication:** Is unified authentication implemented as
      shared service?

### 4. Human Oversight and Iterative Refinement

- [ ] **Human Architectural Oversight:** Has a human architect defined overall
      modular structure and interfaces?
- [ ] **Module-Specific AI Prompts:** Are AI agent prompts narrowly focused on
      specific modules/boundaries?
- [ ] **AI Agent Isolation:** Are AI agents prevented from accessing internals
      of modules they're not assigned to?
- [ ] **Modularity-Focused Code Reviews:** Is code being reviewed specifically
      for adherence to modular design, interface contracts, and separation of
      concerns?
- [ ] **AI-Assisted Refactoring:** Are specific prompts being used to refactor
      monolithic code into modular structures?
- [ ] **Iterative Modular Development:** Starting coarse, then iteratively
      refining modularity?
- [ ] **Task Decomposition:** Are complex development tasks broken down into
      smaller, focused assignments?

### 5. Tooling and Development Environment

- [ ] **Modular Version Control:** Are different modules managed with reinforced
      separation (separate directories, clear boundaries)?
- [ ] **Rigorous Testing Strategy:** Are comprehensive tests implemented?
  - [ ] **Unit Tests:** Individual modules/components tested in isolation
  - [ ] **Integration Tests:** Component interactions within apps tested
  - [ ] **Contract Tests:** Inter-service API communication verified
  - [ ] **Security Tests:** Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning,
        security audits
- [ ] **Automated Interface Testing:** Are automated tests implemented for each
      module, focusing on defined interfaces for independent functionality?
- [ ] **Minimize Direct Dependencies:** Do components interact only through
      declared interfaces?
- [ ] **Security Tooling Integration:** Dependency scanning, container scanning,
      SAST/DAST tools configured?

**üö® CRITICAL: Review this checklist before every development session and
commit!**
